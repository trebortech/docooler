Project Status:

I'm putting this together from other code and documents that I've found online.

My usecase is to provide demonstrations of the SaltStack products interface with
third party API system.


WARNING!!!!
From the notes I'm reading on this device it does have a security risk. 
Once I get my device and dig in deeper I will provide feedback on what I found.


NOTE:
None of this code has NOT been tested. I'm still waiting for my devices to show up.
